    <string name="f.lass">Take your time</string>
    <string name="f.immer">Time and again you may find so called \"Express Recipes\" for baking bread online. They promise fresh, home made bread within a few hours, often with the addition of huge amounts of yeast. Of course, this may be helpful if you want to bake fresh bread on the spur of a moment with little time available. However, if you decide to bake more regularly, with an interest in a markedly tastier result, I propose that you move towards the so called \"Long-Term Fermentation\" You can use this calculator to determine the perfect amount of yeast for your favourite recipy.</string>
    <string name="f.jedes">Each loaf of bread deserves to be baked  through thoroughly</string>
    <string name="f.nichts">Do not rush</string>
    <string name="f.orga">Prepare yourself before baking</string>
    <string name="f.ruck">Setbacks are part of it all - even when baking bread.#You will make a lot of mistakes, especially in the beginning: accidentally using the wrong ingredients, wrong quantities of ingredients, or a classic bread overproofing. Often the dough looks like it needs to be thrown out. My advice to you: Give the dough a chance and place it in the oven. You might be surprised by the result and you\'ll discover a new favorite product.</string>
    <string name="f.dingen">"As with so many things, no  one is born a master. You should be aware of this whenever you chose a recipy. Of   course, the recipes with an incredible number of ingredients sound incredibly exciting, nevertheless I still recommend that you start with easier recipes at the beginning. As soon as you develop a feel for different dough, your basic recipes will begin working well, you can move on to more advanced recipes and inspire others with your knowledge.  "</string>
    <string name="f.teiglinge">When will my dough or dough pieces be ready ?</string>
    <string name="f.daumen">" For a beginner it is difficult to develop a feel for the dough. How long do I still have to knead my dough or how long does my dough have to rest. These are 2 questions I often asked myself at the beginning. There are simple tricks for this: Kneading time: For this you can take a piece of dough,   about the size of a walnut and hold it between your hands. Pull the piece of dough apart, with both hands, with great care and diligence, until a thin layer of dough forms. This layer of dough should be stretched thin enough for light to shine through it. If this thin layer of dough tears, the dough is not kneaded enough. Proofing time of the dough: To solve this \"problem\" there is the so-called thumb test. Use your thumb to make a slight indent in your dough. If the indent springs back immediately, the dough is not quite ready yet. If the indent does not spring back into its original shape at all, the dough has been proofing for too long. For the optimal proofing time, the indent springs back slightly, but not into its 100% original shape. "</string>

    <string name="s.Überschrift">Baking on vacation</string>
    <string name="s.BBQ">"Does the following sound familiar? You go on vacation and want to bake a flatbread to go with the BBQ. Unfortunately, your holiday apartment has neither a scale nor a kneading machine. There are different solutions to these problems.                   "</string>
    <string name="s.go">Go</string>
    <string name="s.mehlwaage">"To measure the flour without a scale, there is a simple solution: You use the bulk density of flour. The bulk density indicates how heavy a substance is in a given volume. Water, as an example, has a bulk density of 1. This means that 1000 ml of water weigh 1 kg. Flour, however, is lighter than water. Therefore, 1000 ml of flour only weigh   about 500-600g. Now you can use a simple cup, or a measuring cup to weigh the flour. Enter the ml number into a calculator and the number of grams will be calculated. "</string>
    <string name="s.Hefewaage">"To measure the amount of yeast without a scale, you can simply shape your fresh yeast into a ball.  Depending on the diameter of the yeast ball, the weight of the yeast can be estimated. Just use the ruler on the screen to measure the size (millimeters) of the ball and enter the value into the calculator. You will receive the amount of yeast in grams. Of course, these are not absolutely accurate values, but they will suffice for the holiday and your spontaneous desire to bake.                    "</string>
    <string name="s.Schüssel">In case you don\'t have a kneading space, just use a bowl and a wooden spoon. This variant is based on the industrial L- shaped paddelkneader. For this purpose you mix all the ingredients in a bowl and mix them with your hand or a wooden spoon. In the second step you place the mixer at one end of the bowl  and use it to pull the dough into the middle of the bowl. Then you turn the bowl a few centimeters, start again at the edge and pull the dough into the middle of the bowl. Repeat this process until your dough stretches well without tearing</string>
    <string name="s.Arbeitsflaeche">If you have a work surface for kneading, you may resort to this variant. There you also mix all the ingredients to start off with. For this purpose you may also use a bowl or your work surface. This procedure is based on a spiral kneader, in which forces are applied from top to bottom. To do this, reach under the dough with your hand and fold it over itself. Following this, the folded piece of dough is pressed into the dough from top to bottom. Finally, the bowl is rotated a few centimeters and the kneading process starts again: You reach under the dough, fold it over itself and press the folded piece into the rest of the dough.</string>
    <string name="s.Kneter">In order to make dough without a kneading machine, you can use the  mode of operation of industrial kneaders as a guide. There are two modes for holidays, which differ in whether you have a workbench available for kneading or not. With both methods, one should take into consideration that the kneading time is longer than with a machine. In order to get an approximate estimate when your dough has been kneaded long enough, you may use the so-called window test.(see -Tips- When is my dough or my pieces of dough ready?)</string>

    <string name="w.Teigausbeute">Dough yield:</string>
    <string name="w.TAerklaert">The dough yield (TA) indicates how many kilograms of water are used per 100 kilograms of flour. The higher the TA, the more water is used. &#10;But please note: The higher the TA, the more difficult it is to process. &#10;As an example: 500 grams of flour and 300 grams of water are used in the recipe. &#10;The result is a dough yield of 160.</string>
    <string name="w.Hydration">Hydration:</string>
    <string name="w.hydrationerklaaert">Hydration is the same as TA, but is expressed as a percentage.

    <string name="settings.Entwickler">The developers introduce themselves:</string>
    <string name="settings.michi">Michi</string>
    <string name="settings.sebi">Sebi</string>
    <string name="VorstellungMichi">My name is Michi. My professional journey began with an apprenticeship as a food technology specialist. Even then, it was clear to me that I wanted to combine my passion for food and technology to develop innovative products and advance the food industry.   In the following two years, I was allowed to work in the quality department and thus gained a deep insight into the processes and standards that are essential for the production of high-quality and safe food.   After my apprenticeship, I continued my education and graduated as a technician in food technology. Now I am about to start a new chapter in my professional career:   I will soon be starting a biochemistry degree. I am very much looking forward to this challenge, as it will allow me to broaden and deepen my knowledge and delve even deeper into the scientific aspects of food development.  Away from my professional career, soccer and music club are my great passions. In soccer, I not only have the opportunity to be active in sports, but also to work in a team and achieve goals together. In my free time I am always open to new experiences. I like to go on hikes to enjoy nature and also like to try my hand in the kitchen to create new recipes.</string>
    <string name="VorstelungSebi">My name is Sebi. My path began with my Abitur at the Technical High School, where I discovered my enthusiasm for technology and innovation.  This was followed by my studies in computer science, which introduced me to the fascinating world of programming and digital technologies.  During my studies, I developed a particular passion for the field of autonomous driving. The idea of having vehicles navigate autonomously using artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms fascinates me immensely. It is an area that is constantly growing and will have a significant impact on the future of mobility.   In addition to my professional career, I am an avid mountain biker. Exploring nature and experiencing the thrill of off-road riding gives me the time out I need from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It helps me clear my head and recharge my batteries to engage in my projects and challenges.</string>

Anyone who has ever noticed a missing ingredient during the hand kneading process and then tried to #take it out of the cupboard with hands covered in dough and weigh it, knows what I'm talking about. Therefore, think about what you need before you start baking and set it up neatly on your work surface. If you are missing a tool, become creative. For example, a pasta sieve with a kitchen towel inserted into it, may be a superb alternative to a fermentation basket."</string>
